# Imgae Search Layer

This is a FFC challenge, it can be used as a image search middleware

This app is deployed on cloud9,you can click [here](https://image-search-layer-masonlee.c9users.io/) to use it.

The search engine is `image.baidu.com` ,which has no specific API for developers.I have to analyse the response and found the search results.
